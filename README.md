# QA Recruitment Test

## Setup

To open Cypress use `npm run cypress`.
To open Cypress use `npm run test`.

## Task

The process of adding products to the cart on https://alpaca-community.snowdog.dev was automated in this repository.
Three tests were prepared to cover basic checks of adding new products:

- add product X where quantity = 1,
- add product X where quantity = 3,
- add product X and product Y.

## TO DO

Example things I would do If I had more time:

- verify if the product is visible on the main cart page,
- verify whether all details in the cart panel are equal to the details of the selected product,
- add scenarios to cover the following scenarios: no color (verify whether the proper error is visible) and/or no size,
- adding/removing items from the cart with the use of the quantity plus/minus buttons..
